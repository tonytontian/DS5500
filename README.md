**What score did you receive?**

24%

**Choose a question from the test, re-state it, and answer it using visualization and summarization. Provide a figure and any relevant output with your answer.**

Original question : Where does the majority of the world population live?

Re-state: what's the distribution of current world-wide population in terms of income level.

I used population dataset to get population data along with country code. And merged with country dataset, where have income group. Used groupby function to calculate the number of population within each income group.

** Interpret the visualization and what you notice. Are they any notable trends and/or deviations from that
trend?  What caveats apply to your conclusions? ** **

Overall, the gdp per capita is increasing for most of region, but for affrica
